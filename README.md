# Project Todos

The purpose of the project was to build a TODO-app using React and Redux.

## The problem

I started up by hardcoding some data which i could store in a slice. After setting a store i App.js i worked on one component at the time. I started with the tasklist-component to render all todos. After that i created the addtask component for adding and removing tasks. I then did the taskcounter component with conditional rendering to display different messages depening on how many tasks where done/left. Finally i styled with styled components. If i would have had more time i would have broken out the styled components to a seperat component. I would also have like to add some functions, like displaying the tasks that are done, an categorising the tasks.
